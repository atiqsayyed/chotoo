data-loader
===========

Utility written in scala to read data from files with different formats csv, excel, txt files etc.

Time and again we go back to writing our own solution for reading/loading data from files like excel, csv, 
text files. This project plans to take away those pains so that we have a standard utility which can read files
for us and has good performance. 

Technology stack : Scala and Akka
